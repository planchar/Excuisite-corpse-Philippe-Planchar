# Exquisite corpse - A day of coding horror

It was a quiet winter morning in my village, just outside of Antwerp. As I was about to execute my first `git` command of the day, suddenly I heard the cries of a _large bird_ approaching the window to my left. Could it be an [omen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen#Ancient_Greece)?

It could be a good omen!
It could spell out good things in the future.
I hear the large bird saying "Philippe will become a master coder in under 7 months"
