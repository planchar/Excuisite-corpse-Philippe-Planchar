# Exquisite corpse - A day of coding horror

It was a quiet winter morning in my village, just outside of Antwerp. As I was about to execute my first `git` command of the day, suddenly I heard the cries of a _large bird_ approaching the window to my left. Could it be an [omen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen#Ancient_Greece)?


It could be a good omen!
It could spell out good things in the future.
I hear the large bird saying "Philippe will become a master coder in under 7 months"

And then the bird hit a wall and fly back again ! It is indeed a omen, a second one ... Predicting an intense learning.

The bird rested on a branch while still being dazed from the wall. But little did he know the branch was still under development, and a snake was on its way!!!

Checking out the branch, the snake came very very close to the bird.
As it was about to **eat it**... Philippe's computer rang the coffee break.
The snake was in conflict. "Should I eat now or drink a coffee?", it thought.

Before he could make a decision, unfortunately, the snake died from a heart attack. 
Sad! 
But not for the bird, who was now saved from a gruesome death.
